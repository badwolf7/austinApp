## Project Description

Design and build a working proof of concept (using whatever front-end technologies you are most comfortable with, i.e. html/css, javascript, any external libraries of your choosing, etc.) of a mobile app for austintexas.gov.

This app should allow a new resident to successfully acclimate to the city and be informed about upcoming public events. You don’t need to worry about specifically knowing any mobile app programming, an html page written to simulate a mobile experience with a combination of original code and existing frameworks would be sufficient.

Your submission should include all of the code you’ve written for this proof of concept, as well as a way for the interviewer to use your finished product. This can take the form of a set of HTML, JS, and CSS files along with some images, zipped up for the interviewer, and preferably a hosted version of the website that lives on your domain. This assignment is given on short notice intentionally and should not take more than 2-4 hours of effort. You will be evaluated more on whether you were able to build something that looks and feels like a 'real' product, rather than the overall quality of code. You will also be evaluated on the visual and interaction design choices you made for this app.
